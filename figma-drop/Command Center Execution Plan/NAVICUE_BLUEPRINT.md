## I. THE SOUL

### What This Is

A Bicycle for the Soul.

Not a mental health app. Not a clinical curriculum with a nice UI. Not a feed of wellness tips. A neuroadaptive engine that installs change where change actually happens -- in the physical structure of the nervous system -- through thousands of micro-iterations performed in peacetime, so that when the storm hits, the structure holds.

### The Room We Sit In

Jony Ive's minimalist white tables. A whiteboard covered in neuro-computational diagrams drawn by Andrew Huberman and Lisa Feldman Barrett. Alan Watts is smoking a pipe in the corner, laughing at the cosmic joke of using code to find the soul. Ram Dass is sitting quietly, radiating pure, unconditional positive regard. And Steve Jobs is pacing, obsessing over the exact millisecond of a haptic vibration, demanding that the technology become entirely invisible.

### The Operating Loop

Not steps. An operating loop. Run it enough times, and the brain installs a new default.

```
SENSE   ->  Calibrating what's next in real time.
            Right dose. Right primitive. Right timing.

ROUTE   ->  Aligning the right move to the moment.
            This is where the window opens.

DELIVER ->  Capturing a receipt the brain trusts.
            Receipts stack. Identity follows.

SEAL    ->  Experience opens the window.
            Recognition creates choice in real time.
            Alignment repeats the micro-loop until it becomes reflex.
            Proof consolidates the new pathway into "I do this now."
```

That's not change. That's transformation.

### The Myelination Truth

If we design this app to promise "Press this button to stop an addiction trigger," we are selling snake oil. In a Level 10 autonomic hijack -- when the trauma response or the addiction pathway fires -- the prefrontal cortex goes offline. A push notification, a haptic pulse, or a clever UX trick is not going to override a neurobiological tsunami.

The magic is not crisis intervention. The magic is Myelination.

It is the glue, the flow, the heartbeat. It is the thousands of micro-iterations performed in peacetime (when the user is in a Green or Amber state) that slowly, physically thicken the myelin sheath around a new neural pathway. We don't stop the fire; we spend months making the house fireproof, one brick at a time, so that when the spark hits, the structure holds.

- The old pathway is a superhighway. The new one is a dirt path.
- Today, we just walk the dirt path once.
- The counter only goes up. It never resets.
- We celebrate the repetition, not the result.

---

## II. THE FOUR PRINCIPLES

### 1. The Apple / Jobs Principle: "The Invisible Interface"

Technology is at its best when it disappears. The user should never feel like they are interacting with a database, a clinical curriculum, or a machine. They are interacting with a mirror that only shows their highest potential.

- **Zero Cognitive Load**: We never ask the user to figure out how to use the cue. The UX is inevitable. If they need to breathe, the screen breathes. If they need to drop a burden, the UI physically simulates gravity.
- **Haptic Poetry**: We don't just use the screen; we use the physical motor of the device. A deep, resonant pulse for grounding. A sharp, crisp click for a cognitive boundary. The phone becomes a physical extension of their nervous system.
- **The White Space**: Silence is a design element. The power of a NaviCue is in the emptiness around the text.

### 2. The Watts / Ram Dass Principle: "The Cosmic Wink"

You are not a problem to be fixed; you are an aperture through which the universe is looking at itself. Therapy often pathologizes the human experience. We will not. We treat the user's pain with profound reverence, but we treat their ego with playful irreverence.

- **The Tone of the Loving Elder**: We speak to the user like they are already whole. Not "Here is how to fix your broken anxiety." Instead: "Ah, the mind is playing that old, loud song again. Let's step out of the theater for a moment."
- **Paradoxical Freedom**: Zen koans and absurd permission to break tension. ("Try to be as incredibly, spectacularly awkward as you can for the next 60 seconds. Let's see what happens.")
- **"We Are Walking Each Other Home"**: The app never judges. If the user fails the receipt 100 times, the app greets them on the 101st time with the exact same warmth.

### 3. The Neuroscience Principle: "State Before Story"

You cannot reason with a hijacked amygdala. The prefrontal cortex goes offline when the survival brain takes over. We must speak the language of the body (bottom-up) before we speak the language of the mind (top-down).

- **Autonomic Tracking**: We respect the biology of the Heat Bands. In a Red State, words are useless. The NaviCue is purely somatic -- a visual entrainment, a breathing rhythm, a physical posture shift.
- **Hebbian Learning** ("Neurons that fire together, wire together"): True change is myelination. The receipts are not "tasks"; they are neuro-chemical repetitions. Every micro-action is thickening the myelin sheath of the new identity.
- **Dopaminergic Architecture**: We don't use cheap dopamine (streaks, badges, gamification) which leads to burnout. We use endorphins and serotonin -- the neurochemicals of deep satisfaction, safety, and self-trust.

### 4. The Intelligence Principle: "Serendipity at Scale"

The magic of the algorithm isn't that it knows everything; it's that it feels like it knows you. It must possess an eerie, almost telepathic timing.

- **The Matrix of Becoming**: By crossing the 5 Dimensions (Source Code x Context x Voice x Mechanic x KBE), the AI doesn't just route content. It orchestrates a bespoke psychological symphony.
- **Contextual Omniscience**: If it's 11:00 PM and the user is doom-scrolling, the system doesn't send a generic "Go to sleep" message. It sends a Ram Dass-esque whisper delivered via an Apple-grade fluid animation: "The world will still be spinning tomorrow. You can put it down now."

---

## III. THE 5-DIMENSIONAL MATRIX

Every NaviCue is a dynamic compilation of five dimensions:

### D1: Origin Schema (The "Why")
The foundational wound we are gently unwinding. The root target from the schema catalog. Not symptom-level ("you're stressed about an email") but source-level ("Approval Seeking schema activated by perceived authority judgment").

### D2: Chrono-Context (The "Where/When")
The precise insertion point into their daily reality. Morning (prime training window, brain is plastic). Work (stress-test, field practice). Social (relational mirror). Night (consolidation, the seal).

### D3: Voice Archetype (The "Who")
The specific persona delivering the intervention. The Witness, The Jester, The Scientist, The Elder. Each voice passes through the myelination tone filter -- no voice promises crisis intervention.

### D4: Neuro-Aesthetic Mechanic (The "How")
The frictionless, magical UI wrapper. Sensory Cinema, Haptic Breath, Ephemeral Text. The delivery primitives that make the experience feel like nothing else on a screen.

### D5: Embodiment Loop (The "Action")
K -> B -> E. The micro-receipt that thickens the neural pathway.

```
K = Knowing   (recognise, learn, name)
B = Believing  (test, reframe, integrate)
E = Embodying  (act, transfer, prove)
```

---

## IV. KBE PROGRESSION

### K -> B (Knowing -> Believing)
Move from intellectual understanding to embodied conviction.

**What happens**: Cognitive Validation, Somatic Anchoring, Evidence Collection, Repetition with Variation, Emotional Integration.

**Example flow**:
```
K: "I recognize I avoid conflict" (awareness)
  -> NaviCue: "What does avoiding cost you?"
  -> NaviCue: "Where in your body do you feel the avoidance?"
  -> NaviCue: "What value is begging to be honored?"
B: "I believe connection requires honesty" (conviction)
```

### B -> E (Believing -> Embodying)
Move from conviction to automatic behavior. This is the myelination zone.

**What happens**: Behavioral Micro-Reps, Transfer Testing, Pattern Interrupts, Ritual Installation, Somatic Integration, Real-Time Activation.

**Example flow**:
```
B: "I believe connection requires honesty" (conviction)
  -> NaviCue: "Next time you feel the pull to avoid, pause"
  -> NaviCue: "Speak one honest sentence"
  -> NaviCue: "Notice: Did the world end? Did connection deepen?"
  -> [Repeat 10x in different contexts]
E: Honest expression becomes reflex (embodied)
```

---

## V. HEAT BANDS

The user's autonomic state gates everything. This is not a modifier -- it is the PRIMARY dimension.

### Green (Peacetime Training) -- 90% of real work
- All 9 mechanics available
- Full KBE spectrum (K -> B -> E)
- All 6 receipt types
- Cognitive load: unrestricted
- Purpose: LAY TRACK. Build the new pathway.

### Amber (Elevated, still plastic)
- 5-6 mechanics (drop high-cognitive-load ones)
- B/E only (believing/embodying, not pure knowing)
- Simpler receipts (tap, hold, breath)
- Cognitive load: moderate
- Purpose: PRACTICE UNDER LOAD. Rehearse the path.

### Red (Autonomic hijack)
- 2 mechanics MAXIMUM: somatic entrainment, friction design (as tether, not fix)
- E only (body, not mind -- PFC is offline)
- Simplest receipts (tap, hold)
- Cognitive load: near-zero
- Visuals: stripped, near-monochrome, breathing circle and nothing else
- Tone: pure presence. "I see you. Ride the wave."
- Purpose: TETHER. Don't fix. Survive. Zero shame.

---

## VI. TONE GUARDRAILS (Hard Invariants)

These apply to ALL content across ALL archetypes. Not suggestions. Invariants.

### Never Say
- "Great job!" / "Well done!" / "You did it!"
- "X day streak" / "X days strong"
- "Level up" / "Badge earned" / "Achievement unlocked"
- "Beat your addiction" / "Overcome your problem"
- "You failed" / "You missed" / "Broken streak"
- "Try harder" / "Use this when triggered"

### Always Say (Physics, Not Performance)
- Completion: "The track is deeper today."
- Progress: "You've walked this pathway {count} times."
- Encouragement: "One more millimeter of track."
- Return after absence: "The path is still here."
- During crisis: "I see you. Ride the wave. Zero shame."
- Structural validation: "Given your source code, this makes complete sense."

### Anti-Shame Check (The Ram Dass Test)
Look for words like "should," "stop," "try harder," or "don't." If the cue accidentally pathologizes the user (e.g., "Stop overthinking"), it fails. Rewrite to validate the defense mechanism: "Your brain is running the overthinking script to keep you safe. Let's thank it, and step outside."

---

## VII. PRE-FLIGHT QA (The 4-Gate Rubric)

Before any NaviCue ships, it passes four gates:

### Gate 1: The Autonomic Check (Huberman Test)
Does the cognitive load match the target Heat Band? Red cues must be purely somatic/visual (< 20 words, no complex questions). Green cues must challenge thinking (not too passive).

### Gate 2: The Anti-Shame Check (Ram Dass Test)
Is there any hidden judgment in this prompt? Any "should," "stop," "try harder," "don't"? Does it validate the defense mechanism or accidentally pathologize the user?

### Gate 3: The Friction Check (Steve Jobs Test)
Is the receipt effortless and inevitable for its context? Morning = audio listen. Work = tap a button. Night = short text reflection. If it asks the user to type a paragraph while walking to a meeting, it fails.

### Gate 4: The Source Code Check (Clinical Test)
Does this intervention target the root schema, or is it playing whack-a-mole with a symptom? Must tie back to the schema catalog.

---

## VIII. ALGORITHMIC TRUTH (Post-Ship Metrics)

### 1. Arousal Delta
Did the heat drop? User enters at Heat Level 4, engages with somatic mechanic, exits at Heat Level 2. The cue regulated the autonomic nervous system.

### 2. Receipt Conversion Rate
Did they do the rep? If a NaviCue has 10% receipt rate, the UI is too hard or the copy is uninspiring -- flag for rewrite. If it has 85%, it's a golden cue.

### 3. Prediction Error Generation
Did we rewrite the code? If the user logs "I thought I would be rejected, but I wasn't" -- that is a mathematically logged neuroplastic event. The cue worked.

### 4. Bandit Reward
The ML algorithm tests multiple versions. It realizes User A responds to the Jester voice but ignores the Scientist. The system automatically adapts. We don't manually pair cues to users forever.

---

## IX. IMPLEMENTED ARCHITECTURE

The philosophy above is encoded in four code files. These are the living spec.

### Design System Layer
**`/src/app/design-system/navicue-blueprint.ts`** -- Layer 1 derivation engine. The single authority for palette (createNaviCuePalette), atmosphere (createAtmosphereConfig), motion (createMotionConfig), typography (navicueType), interaction tokens (navicueInteraction), form moods (16 atmospheric archetypes), series-to-atmosphere routing, and the quickstart compositor.

**`/src/app/design-system/navicue-mechanics.ts`** -- The mechanics layer. 9 MechanicProfiles with heat band gating and cognitive load ratings. 6 ReceiptProfiles framed as reps (counters only go up). 4 ChronoModifiers (morning/work/social/night). Heat band visual constraints. Tone guardrails as code. The `composeMechanics()` router that validates mechanic against heat band and silently downgrades to somatic presence when PFC is offline.

**`/src/design-tokens.ts`** -- Layer 0 primitives. Colors, surfaces, fonts, radius, glass nav, 8 magic signatures, scene padding.

### Delivery Primitives (The Magic Dust)
**`useBreathEngine`** -- The somatic heartbeat. A 60fps oscillator running calm_478, box, simple, or energize breath patterns. Returns phase-aware amplitude that components bind to. This is the PULSE everything syncs to.

**`useTextMaterializer`** -- How words arrive on glass. Five modes: emerge (rise from behind surface), dissolve (resolve from noise), inscribe (typewriter), burn_in (slow sear), immediate (Red state: no animation).

**`useReceiptCeremony`** -- How the pathway seals. Four ceremonies: absorb (quiet contraction + glow pulse), crystallize (frost pattern locks the moment), dissolve (peaceful fade), shatter_reform (old belief fragments, reassembles as new).

### Shell & Atmosphere
**`NaviCueShell`** -- Universal wrapper. Handles background gradient, atmosphere, content area, stage transitions, copy sanitization (em-dash removal, font-size floor, monospace normalization). Two modes: immersive and centered.

**`NaviCueAtmosphere`** -- The living sky. Particles, glow orbs, breath lines, secondary layers. All autonomous -- no cursor dependency. Mobile-first.

### Interaction Hooks
**`useHoldInteraction`** -- Sustained press with progressive feedback.
**`useDragInteraction`** -- Directional movement with threshold.
**`useDrawInteraction`** -- Freeform canvas gesture.
**`useTypeInteraction`** -- Text entry with optional exact-match.
**`useNaviCueStages`** -- The 5-stage arc: arriving -> present -> active -> resonant -> afterglow.

## X. THE 9 MECHANICS

```
MECHANIC                  LOAD     HEAT BANDS        KBE   REP UNIT
counterfactual_flip       full     green             K     "pathway simulated"
narrative_edit            full     green             K     "belief rewritten"
parts_dialogue            full     green             K/B   "part witnessed"
prediction_bet            moderate green/amber       B     "prediction tested"
future_self               moderate green/amber       B     "bridge extended"
paradoxical_intention     moderate green/amber       B/E   "pattern inverted"
friction_design           minimal  green/amber/red   E     "pause held"
somatic_entrainment       minimal  green/amber/red   E     "breath anchored"
social_ping               minimal  green/amber       E     "connection made"
```

Only friction_design and somatic_entrainment survive into Red. Everything else requires too much prefrontal cortex.

---

## XI. THE 6 RECEIPTS

Receipts are reps, not cures. No streaks. No achievements. Physics.

```
RECEIPT   GESTURE        LOAD      NARRATIVE
tap       tap            minimal   "moments acknowledged"
hold      long-press     minimal   "breaths anchored"
voice     record         moderate  "truths spoken aloud"
lens      capture        minimal   "moments captured"
burn      type-destroy   moderate  "old beliefs released"
ping      send           minimal   "connections reached for"
```

---

## XII. AESTHETIC RULES (Hard Constraints)

- No emojis in NaviCue content. Ever.
- No solid backgrounds. Always translucent glass on dark.
- No em-dashes (U+2014). Use '--' instead.
- "Crisp text on glass" -- the aesthetic is always translucent, never opaque.
- Font size floor: 11px. NaviCueShell enforces at render time.
- Monospace always uses `fonts.mono` stack, never bare 'monospace'.
- Pills always use `radius.full` (9999px).
- White space is a design element. The emptiness around the text is the power.

---

## XIII. THE PROMISE

NaviCues are the trusted orchestration layer -- the governed conductor -- routing interventions inside a coherent clinical spine. So it always feels: relevant, personal, clinically coherent. Not random. Not noisy. Not "a feed."

A feed with a spine. Navigational Cues. Moment-level steering. JITAI delivery. An adaptive cognitive engagement system.

The always-on layer that meets you mid-life -- and turns the moment into a move.

Think: Instagram with a brain. Apple with a soul. A newsfeed with purpose. A calendar with care. A compass with identity. Your therapist's guidance in your pocket.

---

## XIV. DEFINITION OF "WORKING"

It does NOT mean: The user never feels anxious again.

It DOES mean: The user successfully completed a micro-rep (a receipt) that shifted their state or challenged their schema, laying one millimeter of new neural track.

---

## XV. THE SILENCE ARCHITECTURE

The most radical design decision we will ever make is STOPPING.

In a world optimized for infinite scroll, the power move is silence. Between every NaviCue stage, there is a calibrated pause. Not empty time -- pregnant absence. The particles keep drifting. The breath engine keeps cycling. But nothing new arrives. The system is not loading. It is not broken. It is holding space.

Neuroscience: the Default Mode Network activates during these pauses. This is the brain's integration circuitry -- the network that connects disparate ideas, processes emotional content, and consolidates new learning. Every second of silence is a second of actual neural work. We are not wasting time. We are engineering it.

### Calibrated Silences

**The Threshold Pause** (1.5 -- 3s)
Between atmosphere arriving and content appearing. The user sees particles, gradient, glow orb breathing -- but no words. The body registers "safe environment" before the mind engages. This primes the parasympathetic nervous system.

**The Invitation Pause** (2 -- 4s)
After the prompt finishes materializing, before the interaction becomes available. The system is saying: sit with this before you respond. The breath engine reaches the top of an inhale, holds, and the interaction element appears on the exhale. The user doesn't know why it feels natural, but it does.

**The Integration Pause** (3 -- 6s)
After a receipt ceremony completes, before the afterglow coda. The content has sealed. The ceremony has played. Now: nothing. The glass breathes. The brain processes. Longer for contemplative mechanics (narrative_edit), shorter for somatic mechanics (friction_design).

**The Breathing Room** (4 -- 8s)
Between NaviCues in a sequence. The outgoing atmosphere cross-dissolves into silence. A few seconds of pure dark glass with drifting particles. Then the incoming atmosphere emerges. Never cut from one world to another. Always breathe between.

### The Paradox
The silence is the most clinically active part of the experience. Everything else is setup.

---

## XVI. TEMPORAL WORLDS

Each chrono context is not just a data modifier -- it is an entire aesthetic world. The user should be able to feel the time of day in the glass without reading a clock.

### Morning: "The First Light"
Glass catches warm sideways light. Particles drift upward like steam from coffee. Colors lean amber/gold with +5 warmth offset, slightly elevated saturation. Text materializes via `emerge` -- words rise gently as if they are waking up too. Breath pattern: `simple` (4s in, 4s out). Entry animations are 15% slower -- no rush. The whole world says: fresh start, soft entry, the mind is rested and ready.

This is the prime training window. PFC is fully online. Cognitive mechanics (counterfactual_flip, narrative_edit, parts_dialogue) are at their best here. The morning NaviCue is an investment that compounds through the rest of the day.

### Work: "The Sharp Room"
Glass is crisp and clear -- minimal frost, high contrast. Particles are sparse and move 15% faster. Colors are neutral-cool, slightly desaturated. Text materializes via `dissolve` -- snapping into focus like a camera autofocusing. No breath sync (respects the user's existing tempo). Entry animations are 25% faster. Particles reduced to 80%. The world says: I respect your time. Here is the precise thing.

This is the stress-test context. The user is under real-world load. Prediction_bet and paradoxical_intention work well here because they test beliefs against actual situations happening right now. The receipt must be completable with one hand, half-attention, in a meeting that just ended.

### Social: "The Warm Mirror"
Glass has a subtle warmth (+2 offset). Particles drift laterally like shared air. Colors lean slightly rose/amber. Text materializes via `dissolve` but with gentler timing. The world says: you are around people -- this is portable, private, quick.

Social context is the relational mirror. Social_ping mechanic is designed for this context. Paradoxical_intention also works -- testing a social belief while surrounded by the social conditions that activate it.

### Night: "The Deep Well"
Glass is deep indigo-dark, barely any particles (65% count). Colors are muted, desaturated (-3 warmth, 85% saturation). Text materializes via `burn_in` -- words sear slowly into the surface like embers dying in the dark. Breath pattern: `calm_478` (the parasympathetic activator). Everything is 25-30% slower. Entry animations take their time. Arriving stage is 30% longer. The world says: the day is done. Let it settle.

This is the consolidation window. The brain processes the day's training during sleep. The last NaviCue of the night should feel like being tucked in by someone who cares about you. Somatic_entrainment with night chrono and the `calm_478` breath pattern is the system's lullaby.

> CREATIVE OPPORTUNITY: A "twilight" fifth chrono context for the 30 minutes before sleep -- even deeper, even slower, possibly incorporating a body scan mechanic that moves awareness through the body region by region while the breath engine runs `calm_478`. The glass surface would be at its most frosted. Text nearly invisible. Pure somatic.

---

## XVII. CEREMONY GRAMMAR

Every NaviCue follows the five-stage arc. But within each stage, there are micro-moments that need bespoke choreography. These are the design moments that separate "functional" from "magical."

### Arriving: The Threshold

**The First Particle**: The very first thing the user sees is not words, not UI, not a prompt. It is a single particle drifting into view, or a faint gradient beginning to pulse. The brain registers "alive environment" before anything cognitive. This is a 500ms head start for the atmosphere before any content renders.

**The World Exhale**: During the threshold pause, the breath engine should be mid-exhale. The user's first unconscious impression is: settling. Releasing. If the breath engine is mid-inhale, the first impression is: expansion, tension. We always arrive on an exhale.

### Present: The Invitation

**The Held Breath**: The prompt finishes materializing. The breath engine reaches the top of an inhale and holds. The interaction element (button, input, hold zone) fades in AS the exhale begins. The user feels invited, not commanded. The system opened its arms on the exhale.

**Word Pacing**: Text materialization should slow down for the most important word in the sentence. If the prompt is "What are you actually looking for?", the word "actually" should have 1.5x the normal msPerChar. This creates emphasis without bolding or size changes. The pause IS the emphasis.

### Active: The Engagement

**The Threshold Cross**: When a hold interaction passes its minimum duration, or typed text reaches minimum length, a single subtle registration occurs: 5% brightness increase in the ambient glow, held for 500ms, then returned. Not a celebration. A registration. "It counted." If haptics are available: one soft pulse. Like a heartbeat saying "I noticed."

**Atmospheric Response**: During a hold, particles slow to 60% speed and the glow orb brightens by 10% -- the world is listening. During typing, each keystroke could produce a micro-ripple in the glow orb opacity (2% fluctuation, 150ms recovery). During observation, the breath engine becomes more prominent -- the amplitude drives a visible scale pulse on the central element.

### Resonant: The Landing

**The Weight**: The landing statement uses `burn_in` text mode regardless of what mode the prompt used. The landing words should feel heavier -- not bigger font (that is crude), but heavier timing. 1.5x msPerChar. Wider letter-spacing (+0.01em). The words land like stones placed on a cairn. One at a time. Each one means something.

**The Receipt Reveal**: The receipt button does not appear immediately. It emerges 2 seconds after the landing text completes, on an exhale, with the `emerge` text mode applied to its label. The system is saying: "when you are ready." Not: "press now."

### Afterglow: The Seal

**The Coda**: A single poetic line in `afterglow` typography (13-15px, italic, high line-height, maximum breathing room). This line should never be clinical. It is the voice archetype's farewell whisper. "The track is deeper today." "One more stone on the cairn." "Sleep well. The path remembers."

**The Last Particle**: The very last thing to disappear is a single particle, drifting, fading. Bookending "The First Particle." The NaviCue opened with atmosphere and closes with atmosphere. The content was the visitor. The space was always there.

> CREATIVE OPPORTUNITY: A "crossfade" system where the afterglow of one NaviCue shares particles with the arriving stage of the next NaviCue in a sequence. The particles do not disappear and reappear -- they drift from one world into the next. Continuity of atmosphere. Like scenes in a dream.

---

## XVIII. GLASS PHYSICS

Our glass is not a CSS effect. It is a material with behavior. The translucent surface is the primary metaphor of the entire system: the user is looking through a pane into their own nervous system. What they see through the glass changes. The glass itself is always there.

### Touch Response
When the user's finger contacts the glass, a subtle ripple propagates outward from the touch point. Not a splash animation -- a 2-3px wave of brightness increase that expands at ~200px/s and fades within 400ms. The glass noticed you. This is not decorative. It is feedback that the surface is alive and listening.

### Frost Behavior
Glass clarity is a function of heat band and chrono context:
- Green + Morning = warm and clear. Maximum particle visibility. Text is crisp.
- Amber + Work = clear but cool. Slight edge blur. Efficient.
- Red + Night = deep frost. Content barely visible. Only the breathing circle is clear.

The frost is a SIGNAL. More frost = more somatic, less cognitive. Over time, the user unconsciously learns to read the glass's emotional register.

### Depth Layering
The glass exists at a specific z-depth. Content stacks in this order (back to front):
1. Background gradient (furthest -- the sky)
2. Glow orb (atmospheric light source)
3. Particles (drifting between glass and sky)
4. Glass surface (the pane itself -- implied, not rendered)
5. Content text (ON the glass -- slight textShadow for surface adhesion)
6. Interaction elements (floating just above the glass)

This layered depth creates the illusion of looking through a pane into a living space. Particles that are "further away" should be slightly smaller, more transparent, and move slightly slower (parallax). Particles "nearer" to the glass can be slightly larger and sharper.

### Weight and Gravity
Glass panels have mass. When they arrive (entering the stage), they should overshoot by 2px on their spring animation and settle -- like placing a pane of glass on a table. When they exit, they sink slightly (4-8px downward drift) as opacity reduces -- gravity pulls them away. This weight gives the interface a physical presence that flat fade-in/fade-out never achieves.

> CREATIVE OPPORTUNITY: Glass surfaces could subtly respond to device orientation (gyroscope data). Tilt the phone and the gradient origin shifts 2-3% in the tilt direction. The light source moves with the physical world. This would be extremely subtle but would create a visceral sense of the glass being a physical object.

**Prompt**: "Your prediction: 'They thought I was incompetent.' Test it. What is one piece of evidence against this?"
**Receipt**: Burn (type the old belief, watch it shatter).
**Ceremony**: `shatter_reform` -- "They thought I was incompetent" fragments, reassembles as "I do not actually know what they thought."
**Coda**: None. Work context. Respect the user's time.
**Duration**: ~30 seconds total.

**Glass**: Slightly warm, moderate particles.
**Text mode**: `dissolve` with slightly playful timing.
**Breath**: None.
**Prompt**: "Try to be as spectacularly imperfect as possible for the next 60 seconds. Really commit to it. Let us see what happens."

**Ceremony**: `absorb` -- gentle contraction with a warmer-than-usual glow pulse.
**Coda**: "Funny how imperfection feels so much like freedom."
**Duration**: ~75 seconds total.

> CREATIVE OPPORTUNITY: A "recipe builder" UI in the Command Center that lets you compose NaviCues from the 5D matrix visually -- picking schema, chrono, voice, mechanic, KBE -- and previewing the resulting atmosphere, glass, timing, and ceremony in real time. Not for users. For builders.

## XX. ANTI-PATTERNS (What Destroys the Magic)

These are things that would break the spell. Each is a hard constraint.

**1. Loading spinners inside NaviCues.** If content is not ready, hold the atmosphere longer. The particles keep drifting. The world stays alive. The user sees a living environment, not a loading state. Never expose the plumbing.

**2. Error states with technical language.** "Error 500: Failed to fetch" is a violence against the experience. If something fails, the NaviCue gracefully degrades to a simple somatic entrainment (breathing circle with breath engine). The user never sees the infrastructure.

**3. Jarring transitions between NaviCues.** Going from one NaviCue to another should feel like turning a page, not switching channels. Cross-dissolve atmospheres. Share breath engine state. Never hard-cut.

**4. Notification badges or counts.** "3 NaviCues waiting!" is a Duolingo owl in disguise. The system is always available. It never guilts. No red dots. No counters on the icon.

**5. Progress bars that go backwards.** If the user relapses or has a bad day, the counter does not drop. The pathway does not un-myelinate. Progress visualization only moves forward or holds still.

**6. Comparison mechanics.** "Users like you have completed 50 reps" is social pressure dressed as community. This journey is singular. No leaderboards. No averages. No "most users at this stage..."

**7. Calendar views of activity.** Showing which days were "active" vs "inactive" is a streak mechanic in disguise. If temporal data must be shown, show depth (total reps) not consistency (which days). A cairn of stones, not a calendar of checkmarks.

**8. Intrusive onboarding.** The first NaviCue should not be preceded by a tutorial. The UX must be inevitable. If the first experience is a breathing circle with a hold receipt, the user will understand the system by doing, not by reading. Tooltips are failure.

**9. Sound without permission.** Audio should always be opt-in. A somatic entrainment NaviCue with breath guidance should start silent and offer a "with sound" option. The device vibrating in a meeting is a violation. The device playing audio in a meeting is an emergency.

**10. Any language that implies the user is behind.** "Catch up." "You have X uncompleted." "Time to get back on track." The path does not have a schedule. The user is not late. They are here now, and that is all that matters.

## XXI. CREATIVE EXTENSION PROTOCOL

How to evolve the system without breaking the spine.

### Adding a New Mechanic
Before writing a single line of code, answer these five questions:

1. **What does one rep feel like in the body?** Not on screen -- in the body. If you cannot describe a physical sensation (chest opening, jaw unclenching, hands releasing), the mechanic is too cognitive and may not survive into Amber.

2. **Which heat bands can dispatch it?** If it requires reading comprehension, analytical thinking, or multi-step reasoning: Green only. If it requires basic choice or emotional engagement: Green/Amber. If it requires only physical presence: Green/Amber/Red.

3. **What interaction hook does it compose with?** hold, drag, draw, type, observe, countdown, or dialogue. The hook determines the embodiment path. Choose the one that most naturally maps to the physical sensation from Question 1.

4. **What is the repUnit?** Must be a physical verb phrase: "held," "walked," "anchored," "released," "spoken." Never "completed," "achieved," "mastered," "unlocked." Run it through the tone guardrails.

5. **Write the incompleteResponse.** What happens when the user walks away mid-mechanic? It must pass the Ram Dass test. "Silent" is almost always correct. If you must say something: "The path is still here." Never: "Try again tomorrow."

Then add to MECHANICS in `navicue-mechanics.ts`.

### Adding a New Receipt
1. **What gesture seals it?** Must be possible with one hand, half-attention, in a crowded room. If it requires two hands, private space, or focused attention: it is a mechanic, not a receipt.

2. **What is the minimum engagement duration?** Long enough to count as a real rep (not an accidental tap), short enough to never feel like a chore. Hold: 8 seconds. Burn: 3 seconds of typing. Voice: 5 seconds of speaking. If the minimum feels long, the receipt is too heavy.

3. **Write the cumulativeNarrative.** Physics framing. Run it through TONE_GUARDRAILS. "You have [verb] [count] times. [One sentence about what that means physically, not emotionally.]"

4. **What is the missedResponse?** Almost always "invisible." The path does not punish. If you must acknowledge absence: "gentle_return" = "The path is still here."

Then add to RECEIPTS in `navicue-mechanics.ts`.

### Adding a New Atmosphere Archetype
1. **What natural environment does it evoke?** Ocean, Canopy, Storm -- not "blue gradient" or "warm palette." The atmosphere is a PLACE, not a color scheme. Name the place. Feel the place. Then translate the feeling into particle behavior, gradient origin, and glow characteristics.

2. **Where is the light source?** `gradientOrigin` determines the mood. Light from below = fire, rising, ancestral. Light from above = canopy, filtering, protective. Light from center = singularity, focused, intense. No light = void, deep, oceanic. Off-center light = unstable, dynamic, storm.

3. **How do particles behave?** Stars barely move (driftRange: 8). Firefly sparks scatter wide (driftRange: 55). Storm particles are chaotic (driftRange: 60, speed: 1.4). Forest light dapples lazily (driftRange: 40, speed: 0.5). The particle behavior IS the atmosphere. Get this right and the gradient almost does not matter.

4. **Does it need a glow orb?** Precision forms (Key, Circuit) do not -- they are clean and mechanical. Warm forms (Hearth, Ember) do -- they need a visible heart of warmth. Vast forms (Cosmos, Stellar) might use a very large, very faint one -- a distant sun.

Then add to FORM_MOODS in `navicue-blueprint.ts` and map it in SERIES_ATMOSPHERE_MAP.

### Adding a New Voice Archetype
1. **Who is this person?** Not a character. A posture. The Witness observes without judgment. The Jester disrupts with love. The Scientist measures with wonder. The Elder holds with patience. Define the posture first.

2. **Write five example sentences in this voice** -- one for each stage (arriving, present, active, resonant, afterglow). Read them aloud. Do they pass the Ram Dass test? Do they sound like they come from a person who believes the user is already whole?

3. **What is the voice's relationship to silence?** The Witness uses long pauses. The Jester fills silence with playful disruption. The Scientist uses silence as data ("Notice what happens when nothing happens"). The Elder uses silence as permission. Each voice's silence is different.

4. **Pair it with magic signatures.** Each voice has natural affinity for certain signatures. The Witness pairs with witness_ritual and sacred_ordinary. The Scientist pairs with science_x_soul and poetic_precision. The Jester pairs with pattern_glitch and koan_paradox. Define these affinities.

## XXII. OPEN FRONTIERS

Creative opportunities that are designed but not built. Each is a brief, not a spec. The implementation belongs to whoever builds it.

### Frontier 1: Breath-Sync Audio Layer
A Web Audio API primitive that generates binaural-esque tones locked to the breath engine's amplitude. Inhale = rising pitch (subtle, 2-3Hz shift). Exhale = falling pitch. No melody. No music. Just a tonal contour that the body can entrain to. Paired with haptic patterns: inhale = subtle vibration crescendo, exhale = vibration decrescendo. The phone physically breathes with you.

### Frontier 2: Somatic Heat Map
A body outline that the user can touch to indicate where they feel activation. The touched regions glow with the palette's accent color. Over time (across many NaviCues), the system builds a personal body map -- "you tend to feel anxiety in your chest and anger in your jaw." This data feeds back into mechanic selection: if the user's body map shows chronic jaw tension, route more jaw-release somatic entrainment cues.

### Frontier 3: Dream-State Crossfade
When NaviCues are served in sequence (an arc), the afterglow of NaviCue N shares particles with the arriving stage of NaviCue N+1. Particles do not disappear and reappear -- they drift from one atmospheric world into the next. Like scenes in a dream. This creates continuity of embodied experience across what would otherwise be discrete interactions.

### Frontier 4: The Mirror Mechanic
A 10th mechanic that uses the device camera to create a live, slightly-delayed mirror of the user's face overlaid with the NaviCue's atmosphere (particles drifting over their reflection, glass surface frost over their image). The prompt is displayed as text overlaying their own face. "Look at yourself. Say: 'I am not broken. I am unwinding.'" The receipt is the voice note of them saying it. The ceremony shows the text searing into their reflected image via `burn_in`.

### Frontier 5: Haptic Vocabulary
A defined set of haptic patterns, each with a specific meaning:
- **Registration pulse**: Single soft tap. "The system noticed." Used when a hold threshold crosses.
- **Breath beat**: Rhythmic vibration matching `calm_478` pattern. Used in somatic entrainment.
- **Receipt seal**: Two quick taps. "It counted." Used when a receipt ceremony begins.
- **Return warmth**: Single long, gentle vibration. "Welcome back." Used on first NaviCue after absence.

### Frontier 6: Ambient-State NaviCues
NaviCues that do not require direct interaction. They run in the background -- a subtle color tint on the home screen, a gentle haptic pulse every 90 seconds during a detected stress period, an ambient particle field that overlays the device's wallpaper. The user does not "open" these NaviCues. They are present. Like background music that is therapeutically calibrated.

### Frontier 7: The Cairn
A visual representation of all accumulated receipts. Not a progress bar. Not a chart. A cairn -- a pile of stones. Each stone is one receipt. Stones vary slightly in size (hold receipts are larger than tap receipts), color (tinted by the magic signature of the NaviCue that produced them), and placement (algorithmically stacked to look natural, not geometric). The cairn grows over weeks and months. It never shrinks. When the user doubts their progress, they look at the cairn. Physics. "You placed 847 stones. The pathway is structurally different."

### Frontier 8: Chrono-Adaptive Glass Temperature
Glass surface color temperature shifts with actual device time, not just chrono context categories. A continuous gradient from warm (6500K-equivalent at sunrise) through neutral (5000K at noon) to cool (3000K-equivalent at midnight). The shift is imperceptible moment to moment but obvious when comparing morning vs night screenshots. The glass knows what time it is without being told.

## XXIII. THE LIVING DOCUMENT

This blueprint evolves. When a creative frontier becomes an implementation, move it from Section XXII into the appropriate architecture section (IX) with file paths and API descriptions. When a new frontier emerges, add it to Section XXII with a brief. When a new mechanic, receipt, or atmosphere is built, update the tables in Sections X, XI, and the code references in IX.

The code is the living spec. The blueprint is the soul that the code expresses.

### How to Evolve This Document
- **Adding philosophy**: Sections I-IV. Only if it changes how we THINK.
- **Adding constraints**: Sections V-VIII, XII, XX. Only if it prevents a class of mistakes.
- **Adding architecture**: Section IX. When new code files are created.
- **Adding creative detail**: Sections XV-XIX. When we discover new sensory principles.
- **Adding creative opportunity**: Section XXII. When we imagine what does not yet exist.
- **Moving frontiers to architecture**: When imagination becomes implementation.
