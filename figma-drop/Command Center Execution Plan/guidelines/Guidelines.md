# Atlas Genesis Build Guidelines

## Foundation (Locked)
- Keep Living Glass, typography hierarchy, and atmosphere grammar intact.
- Keep token authority in shared systems (`navicueType`, `navicueLayout`, `navicueInteraction`).
- Hero interaction remains the primary attention anchor.

## Preserve Magic + Creative Freedom
- Do not lose emotional mystique, intimacy, and poetic resonance in pursuit of technical novelty.
- Do not freeze creativity into rigid templates; allow domain-level experimentation.
- Every advanced mechanic must map cleanly to psychological intent and embodied feeling.
- Prefer bold differentiation over repetitive safety, while staying legible and elegant.
- The north-star test: does this feel like an Apple-grade living companion, not just UI?

## Genesis Composition Formula
Use this matrix for every Genesis-tier NaviCue:

`Psychological Intent + Domain(s) + Atmosphere + Reactive Background + Hero Play + Entrance Pattern`

## Domain Set
- Sensor-Driven Metaphors
- Advanced WebGL
- Kinematic Typography
- Symbiotic Audio-Haptics
- Entrance Materialization
- Bio-Optic Feedback
- Chrono-Mechanics
- Holographic Parallax
- Thermodynamic UI
- Wave Interference

## Hero Play Set
- Velocity Yield
- Phase Alignment
- Radial Expansion
- Gravitational Anchor
- Paradox Weave
- Focal Collapse
- Kinetic Scrub
- Somatic Drop

## Atmosphere Set
- Apex Void
- Dawn Calculus
- Abyssal Trench
- Stratospheric Clear
- Interference Pattern
- Cathedral
- Mycelial Network
- Event Horizon

## Reactive Background Set
- Fluid Topography
- Volumetric Breath
- Gyroscopic Abyss
- Symbiotic Shadow
- Real-World Mirror

## Delivery Rules
- Always provide no-sensor and no-webgl fallback interaction paths.
- Respect reduced-motion users with equivalent semantic completion.
- Keep 48px touch targets and the 11px type floor.
- Define one explicit success event and one explicit release event per interaction.

## Engineering Brief Template
Use this shape when assigning cue implementation:

```
Cue: <id> - <title>
Intent: <psychological intent>
Domains: <1-3 domains>
Atmosphere: <one profile>
Reactive Background: <one engine>
Hero Play: <one play>
Entrance Pattern: <one pattern>
Fallback: <sensor/webgl fallback path>
Success Signal: <what completion looks/feels like>
```
